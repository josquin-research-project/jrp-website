		The Josquin Research Project presents music by both famous composers (e.g., Du Fay, Ockeghem, and Josquin) and lesser-known figures. Many works circulate anonymously; the JRP lists these by the sources in which they appear (e.g., Brussels 5557; Petrucci, <i>Motetti A</i>). Multiple listings are used for works with conflicting attributions. Composers currently represented are shown in the table below (highlighted entries indicate complete or nearly complete coverage):

	<p>
	You can use the word "or" in title searches to search for titles
	which may contain one or another word.	For example, searching
	the title for "dei or deus" will find all titles which have either
	(or both) of those words in the title.
