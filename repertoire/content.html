		The Josquin Research Project presents music by both famous composers (e.g., Du Fay, Ockeghem, and Josquin) and lesser-known figures. Many works circulate anonymously; the JRP lists these by the sources in which they appear (e.g., Brussels 5557; Petrucci, <i>Motetti A</i>). Multiple listings are used for works with conflicting attributions. Composers currently represented are shown in the table below (highlighted entries indicate complete or nearly complete coverage):

		In the period covered by the JRP, sacred works are typically scored for
		four voices (sometimes with sections in reduced texture), secular works
		for three or four.  Five-voice sacred works are relatively common before
		1500; after that still bigger textures emerge.

	<p>
		In grouping pieces by genre the JRP follows the music theorist Johannes Tinctoris (ca. 1435&ndash;1511), who famously divides polyphonic music into three categories: mass, motet, and song. Even though Tinctoris omits certain genres (e.g., the lauda), his categories are helpful in that they encompass so much of the repertory.

	<h4><span class="text-link" style="cursor:pointer; font-size:100%;" onclick="showGenre('mass');">Mass</span></h4>
	<p>
		Intended for liturgical performance, polyphonic masses comprise settings of both the Ordinary (texts that remain the same from day to day: Kyrie, Gloria, Credo, Sanctus, and Agnus Dei) and the Proper (texts that change according to the season or saint being celebrated: typically introits, graduals, alleluias or tracts, sequences, offertories, and communions). The most important musical development in this period is the so-called "cyclic" mass: ca. 1450 composers began to unify all five "movements" of the Ordinary by basing them on a single, pre-existing chant or secular song. One also finds non-unified Ordinary settings, independent movements (or pairs of movements), and weekday masses (<i>de feria</i>/<i>ferialis</i>), as well as Requiem masses, settings that alternate sections of chant and polyphony, and settings of both the Ordinary and the Proper (Plenary cycles).

	<h4><span class="text-link" style="cursor:pointer; font-size:100%;" onclick="showGenre('motet');">Motet</span></h4>
	<p>
		Among Tinctoris's genre categories the motet is the broadest: in this period the word can refer to any Latin-texted work on a sacred theme. Motets could be heard in church, but also at ceremonial occasions and in a variety of "secular" contexts (Pope Leo X, for instance, is known to have heard a motet by Josquin while dining in his chambers). Most Renaissance motets set a single text, but there persists an important bitextual tradition. Motet texts range widely, encompassing canonical chant texts (e.g., antiphons, sequences, responsories, and psalms) as well as newly written texts that celebrate a particular occasion or offer a personal supplication. The JRP adopts a broad definition of the motet that includes these subgenres along with Magnificats, laude, hymns, tracts, and so-called motet "cycles" (e.g., the Milanese <i>motetti missales</i>).

	<h4><span class="text-link" style="cursor:pointer; font-size:100%;" onclick="showGenre('song');">Song</span></h4>
	<p>
		Settings of French courtly love poetry comprise the largest subcategory of polyphonic song in the period. The surviving repertory also includes songs in English, German, Flemish, Czech, Italian, Latin, Spanish, and other Iberian languages. Where applicable, song forms (e.g., rondeau) are noted on the score. Under "song" the JRP also groups motet-chansons (bitextual works in Latin and French), combinative chansons (works with two French texts, usually on different poetic registers), monophonic songs, and textless works, some of which were clearly intended to be performed by instruments.

	<h3 class="brown-border">Searching tips</h3>
	<p>
	You can use the word "or" in title searches to search for titles
	which may contain one or another word.	For example, searching
	the title for "dei or deus" will find all titles which have either
	(or both) of those words in the title.
