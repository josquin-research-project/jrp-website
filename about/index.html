	<h2 class="brown-heading">About the Josquin Research Project</h2>

	<p>
	The Josquin Research Project (JRP) changes what it means to engage with
	Renaissance music. Our open-access website not only hosts an ever-growing
	collection of complete scores, but for the first time makes the music
	fully searchable: in a few clicks you can identify every instance of a
	given melodic and/or rhythmic pattern. The JRP also provides analytical
	tools that can be used to gain insight into individual works, the style of
	a given composer, or the musical lingua franca. The goal of the project
	is to facilitate a new kind of <i>knowing</i> that brings "big data"
	into conversation with traditional analytical methods.

	<p style="margin-bottom:-16px;">
	<span class="myquestion">Why the “Josquin Research Project”?</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	Formed by Jesse Rodin in 2010 in collaboration with Craig Sapp
	at <a href="http://wiki.ccarh.org">CCARH</a>, the JRP was provided
	funding to confront a well-known scholarly problem: of roughly
	340 works attributed to Josquin des Prez, only a fraction are
	securely attributed. As an initial goal, we sought to digitize
	all these works to enable comparative analysis. Drawing on a <a
	href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/26188059">foundational essay</a> by
	Joshua Rifkin, we chose the name "Josquin Research Project" in emulation
	of the <a href="http://www.rembrandtresearchproject.org">Rembrandt Research
	Project</a>, which is similarly interested in questions of attribution.
	</p>

	<p style="margin-top:-8px;">
	Shortly after beginning our work, we came to see how much more
	this project could accomplish. While we continue to be interested in
	attributive research, we now pose a range of questions aimed at discerning
	relationships among pieces, composers, genres, even whole periods. By
	way of example: How does style change over time? What separates a song
	from a mass? What really makes one composer different from another?
	</p>

	<p style="margin-bottom:-16px;">
	<span class="myquestion">What is your process for putting music online?</span>
	</p>

	<ol style="margin-left:0;">
	<li>Using facsimiles and modern editions, we enter music using the notation software Finale, then tag items such as mensuration signs and section headings.</li>

	<li>Rodin reviews each file by listening to it twice: once while
	viewing it in Finale, another time while reading along with the reference
	score. (During this process he adjusts editorial accidentals.) He then
	exports the file into Music XML.</li>

	<li>Sapp translates the MusicXML data into
	<a href="http://www.humdrum.org/guide/ch02">Humdrum syntax</a>, which is
	used to create search indexes, analyze the music, and generate graphical
	scores for display on the JRP website.</li>

	<li>Rodin checks the online version for errors.</li>
	</ol>

	<p style="margin-top:-18px;">
	If you find a mistake, please visit the relevant Work page and submit an
	<a href="/error-reports">error report</a>.
	</p>

	<p style="margin-bottom:-16px;">
	<span class="myquestion">How good is your data?</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	We pride ourselves on presenting extremely high-quality data. Not
	only do we transcribe from reliable sources, but we also go out of our
	way to remove what we consider to be unhelpful features of some modern
	editions (e.g., quixotic barring). When we transcribe, we enter the music
	voice-by-voice in real time; listening to how each newly added voice fits
	with the others helps prevent errors. Equally important is the threefold
	review process undertaken by the project director (see above).
	</p>

	<p style="margin-bottom:-16px;">
	<span class="myquestion">Why do JRP editions use original note values and mensuration signs?</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	We believe modern editions should facilitate comparison with original
	sources. We also want users to be able to compare works across composers,
	genres, and time periods without having to adjust for different editorial
	policies.
	</p>

	<p style="margin-bottom:-16px;">
	<span class="myquestion">Why doesn’t the JRP encode variant readings or text underlay?</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	In an ideal world we would. Unfortunately doing so would take so much
	time that new works would be added at a snail’s pace. This points
	up an important aspect of the project: the JRP is above all a powerful
	finding aid and analytical tool. It is not intended to replace published
	critical editions.
	</p>

	<p style="margin-bottom:-16px;">
	<span class="myquestion">Why don’t all JRP editions include editorial accidentals?</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	Rifkin has argued that editorial accidentals, while <i>implicit</i> in the
	sources that have come down to us, are not strictly speaking <i>part of</i>
	the musical texts. They belong instead to the realm of realization:
	it is up to the singer to decide between what we today would call <i>f</i> and
	<i>f#</i>. For all of this, we recognize that many people find editorial
	accidentals helpful. The JRP therefore offers two versions of each score:
	one free of editorial accidentals, another that displays accidentals
	that have been added by the project director. (The latter underpins our
	MIDI files; for practical reasons, decisions about which accidentals to
	include cannot be weighed with great care.) All JRP analyses depend on
	the version of the score without editorial accidentals.
	</p>

	<p style="margin-bottom:-16px;">
	<span class="myquestion">Why does the JRP use unconventional Latin spellings (e.g., "celi")?</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	For the sake of transparency, we generally adopt the spellings used in the
	surviving musical sources.
	</p>

	<p style="margin-bottom:-16px;">
	<span class="myquestion">I’m working on repertoire that I want to see on the JRP site. How can I help make this happen?</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	Volunteer to transcribe for us! We'll need you to "<a href="http://wiki.ccarh.org/wiki/Josquin_Project_encoding_standards">tag</a>" your
	Finale files for use by the JRP; to that end we can make available a
	series of straightforward instructional videos. (By way of example,
	the first section of a Kyrie must be labeled: "Section: Kyrie I.")
	</p>

	<p style="margin-bottom:-16px;">
	<span class="myquestion">What if this repertoire falls outside the JRP’s chronological range (ca. 1420–1520)?</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	We would still be happy to consider it. (We already host some
	mid-sixteenth-century music in the form of motets posthumously attributed
	to Josquin.)
	</p>

	<p style="margin-bottom:-16px;">
	<span class="myquestion">What are the project’s funding sources?</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	The JRP has received funding from the American Council of Learned
	Societies and from Stanford University, with in-kind support from the
	Center for Computer Assisted Research in the Humanities
	(<a href="http://www.ccarh.org">CCARH</a>).
	</p>

	<p style="margin-bottom:-16px;">
	<span class="myquestion">How can I contribute?</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	The JRP is constantly developing new tools and expanding our
	database of scores. To make a tax-free donation through Stanford
	University, enter "Josquin Research Project" in the "Special
	instructions/Other designation" field <a
	href="https://alumni.stanford.edu/get/page/makeagift?indexredir=r">here</a>.
	We also welcome donations of data and time. Occasionally we are able
	to hire paid employees.
